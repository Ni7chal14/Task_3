Elevate Labs Internship Task-3 26th June 2025

I started by importing and preprocessing the housing dataset. I applied one-hot encoding to handle categorical variables, then separated the features (X) and the target variable (price). After splitting the data into training and testing sets, I trained a Linear Regression model. I then evaluated the model's performance using MAE, MSE, and R² score. Finally, I visualized how each feature impacts the predicted price by plotting the model’s coefficients using a bar chart.
